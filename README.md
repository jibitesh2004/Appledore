# Appledore
A simple and efficient graph library in modern C++ Supports directed/undirected graphs with customizable edge type and vertices, designed for performance and ease of use.

## Features
- Adjacency matrix-based representation.
- Adjacency list-based representation
- Supports custom vertex and edge types
- Efficient management of vertices and edges
- Easy querying of graph structure and properties
- Upcoming features: support for graph degrees, advanced graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, BFS, DFS), and additional utilities for graph analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```
 git clone https://github.com/SharonIV0X86/Appledore
